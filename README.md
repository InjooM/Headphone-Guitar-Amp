Electric guitar amplifier for 3.5mm headphones

I've been meaning to work on my Github more, and I thought this personal project would be the perfect addition to my portfolio.

I've been needing a guitar amplifier, so I decided to make one. I found a schematic online for a Class AB audio amplifier, and I'm trying my best to follow a procedure where I can ensure the ability to diagnose and treat each and every problem that occurs within my design.

First, I found my [amplifier circuit](http://www.generalguitargadgets.com/pdf/ggg_mxr_hpamp_sc.pdf), and drew it out to help me understand and analyze it. Then simulated it.
